[`K`](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot) is a very low latency [market making](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md#what-is-market-making) trading bot with a fully featured [web interface](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui). The bot can place and cancel orders on one of [several supported cryptocoin exchanges](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#compatible-exchanges) in less than a few miliseconds per order on a decent machine.

### Docker Installation

See [etc/Dockerfile](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/tree/master/etc#dockerfile) section if you use winy (because the Manual Installation only works on unix-like platforms).

### Manual GIT Installation

0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).

1. Ensure your target machine has `git`, `make` and `vim` installed.

2. Download it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K) and execute the installer:
```
 $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot K
 $ cd K
 $ make install
```

3. Open the config file in your favorite text editor:
```
 $ vim K.sh
```

To upgrade anytime see [Upgrade to the latest commit](#upgrade-to-the-latest-commit) section.

### Manual ZIP Installation

0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).

1. Ensure your target machine has `curl`, `make` and `vim` installed.

2. Download it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K) and execute the installer:
```
 $ mkdir K
 $ cd K
 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/master/Makefile > Makefile
 $ make install
```

3. Open the config file in your favorite text editor:
```
 $ vim K.sh
```

To upgrade anytime just run `make reinstall`.

### After Manual Installation

See [configuration](#configuration) section while setting up the configuration options in your new config file `K.sh`.

Once the config file is ready, you can start the bot:
```
 $ ./K.sh
```

Alternatively use `make start` to run `K.sh` in the background using [screen](https://www.decf.berkeley.edu/help/unix/screen.html) (to see the output, attach the screen with `make screen` [or run all at once with `make start screen`]).

Feel free to run `make stop` or `make restart` anytime, and don't forget to [read the fucking manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).

Troubleshooting:

 * If there is no wallet data on a given exchange, do a manual buy/sell order first using the website of the exchange.

 Optional:

 * See `./K.sh --help` and `make help`.

 * Use your own SSL certificate with `--ssl-crt` and `--ssl-key`, see [web ui](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui) section. Otherwise, the unsecure built-in certificate is a fully featured default openssl, that you may just need to authorise in your browser.

### Configuration

See [etc/K.sh.dist](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/etc/K.sh.dist) file or your own `./K.sh` file.

It just contains a few variables with examples ready to be reused. The very end of the file contains the code that starts the bot.

### Upgrade to the latest commit

After reinstalling, you will need to manually restart any running instances using `make restart` or `make restartall`.

To upgrade under Manual ZIP Installation, please run `make reinstall`.

To upgrade under Manual GIT Installation:

Feel free anytime to check if there are new modifications with `make diff`.

Once you decide that is time to upgrade, execute `make latest` to download and install the latest modifications in your remote branch (or directly `make reinstall` to skip the validation of the new commit messages).

If you only use `git` to pull the latest commits, you will still need to recompile using `make reinstall` (or using `make dist K` or just `make` if you have modified source files) and then `make restart` to start using the latest version.

### Multiple instances party time

Please note, an "instance" is in fact a `*.sh` config file located in the top level path; using a single machine and the same source folder, you can run as many instances as `*.sh` files you have in the top level path (limited by the available free RAM).

You can list the current running instances with `make list`.

If you haven't defined a config file, `make start`, `make screen`, `make stop` and `make restart` will use the default config file `K.sh`.

To run multiple instances using a collection of config files:

1. Create a new config file with `cp etc/K.sh.dist X.sh && chmod +x X.sh` (use `X.sh` or any name but keep `.sh` extension).

2. Edit the new config file `vim X.sh`

3. Run the new instance with `./X.sh` or to run in the background, use `K=X.sh make start`. To attach to the new instance's screen, use `K=X.sh make screen`. To stop the new instance, use `K=X.sh make stop` and to restart it, use `K=X.sh make restart`. The environment variable `K` specifies the filename of the config file that you want to use.

4. Open in the web browser the different pages of the ports of the different running instances, or display the UI of all instances together in a single page using the MATRYOSHKA link in the footer (that can be predefined using the optional argument `--matryoshka=URL`).

After multiple config files are setup, to control them all together instead of one by one, the commands `make startall`, `make stopall` and `make restartall` are also available, just remember that config files with a filename starting with underscore symbol "_" will be skipped.

### Application Usage

1. Open your web browser to connect to HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) of the machine running K. If you're running K locally on Mac/Windows on Docker, replace "localhost" with the address returned by `boot2docker ip`.

2. Read up on how to use K and market making in the [manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).

3. Use the web UI to change the quoting parameters. Click the "BTC/USD" button to start making markets. Click it again to stop. When the button is green, the bot is actively placing orders.

### Web UI

Once `K` is up and running, visit HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) to access the UI (i.e. [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)). There are inputs for quoting parameters, grids to display market orders, market trades, your trades, your order history, your positions, and a big button with the currency pair you are trading. When you're ready, click that button green to begin sending out quotes. The UI uses angularjs hydrated with websockets observed with reactivexjs.

If you want to generate your own certificate see [SSL for internal usage](https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).

In case you really want to use plain HTTP, use `--without-ssl` argument.

### Databases

Each currency pair of each exchange will use a different sqlite database file with [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) enabled.

All database files are located at `/var/lib/K/db/K-*.db*`, outside the download folder to survive wild `rm -rf path/to/K` or reinstalls.

You can copy any group of `*.db*` files to another machine when migrating or as a backup.

If a database does not exist, the application will create it on boot; otherwise, it will use the existing one.

To explore each database you can use https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser or a similar tool.

To set a different database filename or to set an [in-memory database](https://sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), use `--database=FILE` argument (see `--help`).

Even if using an in-memory database, the quoting parameters are always loaded from and saved into the disk file database.

### Charts

The metrics are not saved anywhere, it is just UI data collected with a visibility retention of `n` hours (where `n` is the value of `profit` quoting parameter), to display over time:

 * Market Fair Value with High and Low Prices
 * Trades Complete
 * Target Position for BTC currency (TBP)
 * Target Position for Fiat currency
 * STDEV and EWMA values for Quote Protection and APR
 * Amount available in wallet for buy
 * Amount held in open trades for buy
 * Amount available in wallet for sell
 * Amount held in open trades for sell
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in BTC currency
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in Fiat currency

### Cloud Hosting

If you ask me, [<img height="20px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634027/29756933-3e64c62e-8ba8-11e7-916a-3b0ae1481a52.png">](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?475987/cloud/) is a very nice web hosting company (awesome support team, awesome servers). Feel free to use this referral link to get a discount subtracted from my referral earnings (i'm a user since 2008).

### Build notes

Make sure your build machine has [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed, and also ensure `make dist` provides all dependencies without errors.

To rebuild the application with your modifications, see `make help` and choose a target (just `make` may be what you are looking for).

Test units are executed before the application exits, only if the application was compiled with `KUNITS=1 make`.

Otherwise, just `make` without the environment var `KUNITS` produces an application that simply exits on exit.

A quick test runner therefore is `./K.sh --version` or the alias `make test` or all at once with `KUNITS=1 make K test`.

To pipe the output to stdout, execute the application in the foreground with `./K.sh --naked`.

To ignore the output, execute the application in the background with `screen -dmS K K.sh` or with the alias `make start` or simply `./K.sh`.

### Unlock

The bot is unlocked for collaborators and contributors (feel free to make acceptable Pull Requests for already opened issues or for anything you consider useful, and let me know the BTC Payment Address for the bot that you wish to unlock in the description of the PR, and I will credit it for you).

While locked, the orderbook will be not in realtime, instead market price levels will be updated only once every 7 seconds.

Anonymous users can also unlock any API Key by paying 0.01210000 BTC to the address displayed. Once unlocked you may use different currency pairs or reinstall on a different machine with the same unlocked API Key. However, if you want to use more than one exchange, you will need to pay again to unlock the API Key for each exchange.

Otherwise if you choose to not support further development by ctubio, just keep running some old commit and do not upgrade (any commit prior to v0.3.0 was completely unlocked).

Please don't open issues asking how much % less the bot generates with `--free-version`; it is relative to your trading strategy, the market conditions, and the bot's performance.

### Donations

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
